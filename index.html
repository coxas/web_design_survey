        Data Disclosure Statement
    </h3>
    <p>
        This survey is being administered as part of a study on web design preferences. We are researching the correlation between certain demographic characteristics and preferences regarding several fundamental concepts in web design. 
    </p>
    <p>
        "Web Design" is a term that encompasses many aspects of visual design. In this study, we are using the phrase to refer to discrete aspects of a webpage, including visual, audio, and interacive components. Each question in the web design portion of the survey asks about one specific component.
    </p>

    <p>For this survey we would like you to think about simple web <em>sites</em>, not web <em>services</em> or web <em>applications</em>. Web services and applications usually provide some service to the user and require a high level of user participation or interaction. Examples of web services and applications include Facebook, GMail, Amazon, or Google. <u>We do not want you to think about these types of web services when answering the questions about design preferences in our survey (questions 13 - 22).</u>
    </p>
    <p>In contrast, simple web <em>sites</em> are mostly for users to view and read. Examples might include someone's personal webpage with information about themselves, a political campaign website, a business website, or a blog.</p>
    <p>Think about some simple web sites that you have visited lately. What did they look like? Can you visualize them in your head? Do you remember what you liked or disliked about the site? These types of observations will be helpful when answering our survey questions.</p>
